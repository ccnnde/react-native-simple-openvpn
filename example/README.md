# Example

This is an example only for **Android**.

I use free OpenVPN configuration file from this site [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/).
I am not sure how long it will work with the free ovpn file. It's better to update ovpn files with your own ovpn.

> Note that OpenVPN may always wait for the server to respond due to your network.

You can also try to use [docker-openvpn
](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md) to deploy a VPN service locally.

## Usage

```sh
yarn

yarn android
```
